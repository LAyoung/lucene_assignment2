<title> foreign minorities, Germany

<desc> Description:
What language and cultural differences impede the integration
of foreign minorities in Germany?

<narr> Narrative:
A relevant document will focus on the causes of the lack of
integration in a significant way; that is, the mere mention of
immigration difficulties is not relevant.  Documents that discuss
immigration problems unrelated to Germany are also not relevant.
